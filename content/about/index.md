      I am a BE/MS student at <a href="https://home.dartmouth.edu/" target="_blank">Dartmouth College</a> majoring in Electrical Engineering as part of the <a href="https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/dual" target="_blank">Dual Degree Program</a>. I am advised by <a href="https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/community/faculty/mattias-fitzpatrick" target="_blank">Mattias Fitzpatrick</a>. I am broadly interested in quantum information science. My more recent focus has spanned superconducting qubits, computational quantum optics, and combinatorial optimization.

      Previously I was at <a href="https://www.amherst.edu/" target="_blank">Amherst College</a> where I double majored in Computer Science and History, and had the fortune to be advised by <a href="https://lpentecost.github.io/cv/" target="_blank">Lillian Pentecost</a> and 
      <a href="https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/gqiao" target="_blank">George Zhijian Qiao</a>. At Amherst, I worked on optimizing parallel graph algorithms. On the history side, I was much fascinated by the frontier regions and borderlands of late Imperial China.

      I also spent some time working at <a href="https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/" target="_blank">Hudson River Trading</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>.

      I am from the beautiful city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou" target="_blank">Hangzhou, China</a>, and grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver" target="_blank">Vancouver, Canada</a>.
