I am a BE/MS student at [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/) majoring in Electrical Engineering as part of the [Dual Degree Program](https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/dual). I am advised by [Mattias Fitzpatrick](https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/community/faculty/mattias-fitzpatrick). I am broadly interested in quantum information science. My more recent focus has spanned superconducting qubits, computational quantum optics and combinatorial optimization.

Previously I was at [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu/) where I double majored in Computer Science and History, and had the fortune to be advised by [Lillian Pentecost](https://lpentecost.github.io/cv/) and [George Zhijian Qiao](https://www.amherst.edu/people/facstaff/gqiao). At Amherst, I worked on graph processing and analytics. On the history side, I was much fascinated by the frontier regions and borderlands of late Imperial China.

I also spent some time working at [Hudson River Trading](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/) and [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/). 

I am from the beautiful city of [Hangzhou, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangzhou), and grew up in [Vancouver, Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver).
