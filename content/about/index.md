I am a BE/MS student at [Dartmouth College](https://home.dartmouth.edu/) majoring in Electrical Engineering as part of the [Dual Degree Program](https://engineering.dartmouth.edu/undergraduate/dual). I am broadly interested in quantum information science. My more recent focus has been in the intersection of quantum computation, high-performance computing and combinatorial optimization.

Previously I was at [Amherst College](https://www.amherst.edu/) where I double majored in Computer Science and History. At Amherst, I worked on graph processing and analytics. On the history side, I was much fascinated by the frontier regions and borderlands of late Imperial China.

I also spent some time working at [Hudson River Trading](https://www.hudsonrivertrading.com/) and [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/).
