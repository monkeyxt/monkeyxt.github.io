Though I am now well in the lands of applied physics and engineering, I have always enjoyed knowing and teaching theoretical computer science. My favorite algorithm is [Karger's Min-Cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karger%27s_algorithm). My favorite complexity classes are [BQP](https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Zoo:B#bqp) and [#P](https://complexityzoo.net/Complexity_Zoo:Symbols#sharpp). I have served as a TA at Dartmouth for the following theory classes:

- COSC-30 Discrete Mathematics (Winter 2025)
- COSC-31 Algorithms ([Winter 2024](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/63142), Fall 2024, [Winter 2025](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/69996))
- [COSC-32/232 Advanced Algorithms (Fall 2025)](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/74979)
- [COSC-34/234 Randomized Algorithms (Spring 2024)](https://canvas.dartmouth.edu/courses/65543)
- [COSC-39 Theory of Computation (Spring 2025)](https://hcsoso.github.io/teaching/model-comp-s25/index.html)
- ENGS-27 Discrete and Probabilistic Systems (Summer 2025)
